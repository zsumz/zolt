# Dependency Updates — Design Record

Status: decided 2026-07-22. Implementation contract for `zolt outdated` and
`zolt update` plus the external Renovate manager spec.

## Command naming

The top-level `zolt update` (today a redundant alias of `zolt self update` for
binary self-update) is REPURPOSED for dependency updates. Binary self-update
stays fully reachable at the canonical `zolt self update` (the self-update
notice already points there). The old alias command class is deleted;
`RootCommandListRenderer` moves `update` into the Dependencies group and adds
`outdated`; `ZoltToolchainNoticeHook`'s update suppression re-keys to the self
path; reflect-config and the help-surface fixture update accordingly.

## Boundary contract (append to USAGE "Resolution and Lockfile Contracts")

Version discovery is advisory-only. `maven-metadata.xml` is fetched ONLY by
`zolt outdated` and `zolt update`. Resolution (`zolt resolve`, `--locked`,
build/test/package, workspace resolve, `explain verify`) never fetches, reads,
or is influenced by version listings, and `zolt.lock` never records one. A
discovered version enters a build only when written as a fixed literal into
`zolt.toml` and re-resolved. Enforced structurally (no `zolt-resolve` →
discovery dependency) and by a test asserting a resolve issues zero
`maven-metadata.xml` requests.

## Metadata cache policy (TTL rejected)

Listings are mutable and never touch the immutable artifact cache. Separate
namespace `~/.zolt/cache/metadata/<repoId>/<groupPath>/<artifactId>/
maven-metadata.xml` + `.fetched` timestamp sidecar, atomic writes. Online:
always refetch; on transient failure fall back to cache WITH a staleness note.
`--offline`: cache only; missing listing → status unknown with note. TTL was
steelmanned (bandwidth, Maven familiarity) and rejected: a TTL silently serves
a wrong "up to date" inside the window; fallback-only-on-failure is always
annotated. Conditional GET is a future optimization that preserves
always-refresh semantics.

## Discovery layer (modules/zolt-repository, new package sh.zolt.maven.metadata)

`MavenRepositoryPathBuilder.metadataPath(group, artifact)`;
`MavenRepositoryClient.fetchMetadata(...)` → `Optional<byte[]>` (404 → empty,
retries per existing policy); `MavenMetadata` record (versions list; ignore
latest/release hints); `MavenMetadataParser` (hardened XML config mirroring
RawPomParser); `MetadataCache`; `RepositoryMetadataService` orchestrator.
Repository list + auth + order come from the SAME planner resolve uses —
promote/extract `RepositoryAccessPlanner` so discovery and resolve share one
implementation (alphabetical-by-id order preserved). Listings are UNIONED
across repos (dedup by exact version string; a candidate's `source` = first
repo in query order listing that version). First-found-only was rejected: it
hides newer versions that live only in a lower-priority repo. Missing metadata
degrades to status unknown, never an error.

## Classification (modules/zolt-model, beside VersionComparator)

Reuse `VersionComparator` verbatim for ordering. New: `UpdateClass`
{PATCH, MINOR, MAJOR}; `VersionStability` {RELEASE, PRERELEASE, SNAPSHOT} —
SNAPSHOT always excluded regardless of flags; PRERELEASE iff a KNOWN
negative-rank qualifier token {snapshot, alpha, a, beta, b, milestone, m, rc,
cr}; **unknown qualifiers are RELEASE** (load-bearing: keeps `33.4.8-jre`,
`-android`, calver eligible). `VersionClassifier`: releaseCore = leading
numeric tokens {major, minor, patch}; candidates(current, listing,
includePrereleases) → latestPatch (same major.minor), latestMinor (same
major), latestMajor (overall), selectedInMajor (update default target),
selectedLatest (--latest target). A prerelease current sees same-core GA as
PATCH.

## `zolt outdated` (new module modules/zolt-update, thin CLI command)

Surfaces enumerated: `[versions]` aliases (primary lever; `governs` lists
referencing coordinates), literal-versioned deps in every scope (skip
versionRef entries — they report under their alias), `[platforms]` (managed
deps report under the PLATFORM, never per-dep; effective versions shown from
lock), `[annotationProcessors]`/test, `[dependencyConstraints]`,
`[generated.execTools]` jvm coordinates + protobuf/openapi tool refs. Ignored:
`[toolchain.*]` (separate lifecycle), workspace-member deps, SNAPSHOT
literals. Flags: `--format text|json`, `--include-prereleases`, `--all`,
`--offline`, selectors (coordinate | alias | section token). Workspace: per-
member blocks + root, shared-coordinate dedup note. JSON schema v1: stable
keys, nulls not omission, `surface` ∈ {versionAlias, dependency, platform,
annotationProcessor, dependencyConstraint, execToolCoordinate, protobufTool,
openapiTool}, `status` ∈ {current, update-available, unknown}, candidates by
class + selectedInMajor/selectedLatest + source repo + governs + members.
Deterministic ordering (aliases first, then group:artifact sort).

## `zolt update`

Default = latest STABLE within current MAJOR. `--latest` allows majors;
`--patch|--minor|--major` set the ceiling; `--include-prereleases` widens
(never SNAPSHOT); selectors scope. `--dry-run` prints a SEMANTIC edit list
(the TOML writer re-serializes whole files, so text diffs are noise) with
from → to, class, and fan-out counts; `--format json` emits edits[]/skipped[].
Apply path uses ONLY existing mutation machinery: aliases via
withVersionAliases (the primary lever; ALWAYS warn with the full fan-out list
— extend VersionAliasCommands.references to also scan execTool/protobuf
versionRefs, which it misses today); literal deps via
ProjectConfigDependencyMutator.addDependency in their actual section
(metadata — exclusions/classifier/type/optional — is preserved by the
retained-metadata path); platforms via addPlatform; constraints rebuilt
preserving kind/reason. A versionRef-backed coordinate NEVER gets a literal
written — its alias updates instead. Literal execTool coordinate mutation is
stage 3; until then update reports them as skipped. Comment-rewrite warning
preserved. After a successful write, resolve runs BY DEFAULT (`--no-resolve`
opts out; `--dry-run` does neither) — matches every sibling mutation command
and keeps zolt.lock consistent; the steelman (bulk-bump review, CI staging)
loses because the edit is already saved and `--dry-run` is the review valve.
`update` has NO zolt.lock read/write path of its own.

## Renovate manager spec (appendix — external repo, not built here)

File match `(^|/)zolt\.toml$`; datasource=maven; registryUrls from
`[repositories]`. Shapes: inline `"g:a" = "v"` in all dependency scopes;
inline table `{ version = "v", ... }`; versionRef indirection → the updatable
unit is `[versions].<name>`; `[platforms]` (packaging=pom);
`[dependencyConstraints]`; execTools coordinate arrays + protobuf/openapi
tool refs through `[versions]`. Must never touch `[toolchain.*]`, workspace
paths, SNAPSHOTs; must only write fixed literals. PREFERRED bridge:
`zolt outdated --format json` as a custom datasource — Zolt's own comparator
and stability rules are the single source of truth; regex shapes are the
fallback for shops that won't run zolt in the bot.

## Refusals

No auto-PR creation, no scheduling, no toolchain JDK updates, no ranges ever
written, no SNAPSHOT suggestions, never edits zolt.lock, never fetches
metadata during resolve/build.

## Stages

1 (M): discovery layer + classifier + `zolt outdated` (all surfaces, JSON +
table, workspace, offline/fallback). 2 (M): `zolt update` (plan/apply engine,
semantic dry-run, default-resolve, fan-out warnings, command repurpose).
3 (S, later): literal execTool mutator + conditional GET.
Tests: metadata fixtures on the local HTTP harness (union/order/404/fallback/
offline), classifier units (jre-flavor, rc→GA, calver, prerelease widening),
parser hardening, apply round-trips (metadata preservation, alias-not-literal,
dry-run writes nothing), the zero-metadata-requests resolve boundary test,
CLI surface tests + reflect-config/help-fixture updates.

## Must-not-do

1. Metadata leaking into resolve or the lock (module boundary + boundary
   test). 2. Metadata stored in or served through the immutable artifact
   cache. 3. Update corrupting intent: dropped dependency metadata, literal
   written over a versionRef, suppressed comment warning, or any range.
