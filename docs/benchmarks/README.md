# Benchmarks

Zolt benchmark claims should be backed by repeatable evidence, not a single
headline number.

The suite combines controlled generated Java workspaces, pinned real-project
lanes, specialist large-source comparisons, and optional OpenAI summaries over
the structured result. See [plan.md](./plan.md) for the benchmark architecture.
The real-project lane manifest lives in [projects.json](./projects.json).

The public entrypoint is `scripts/benchmark-suite`. It runs selected benchmark
lanes, writes one suite-level summary, and keeps each lane's raw evidence under
the suite artifact. The generated Java workspace lane uses
`scripts/benchmark-competitors` underneath. It generates byte-for-byte identical
Java sources and equivalent dependency graphs for Zolt, Maven, and Gradle, then
records wall-clock samples for workflows that matter on larger projects:

- first clean build as a single setup lane;
- warm no-op build;
- leaf source change build;
- root or shared library source change build.

Generated workspaces support three graph shapes:

- `wide` (the default): independent libraries feed one app, exposing one large
  parallel compilation wave;
- `layered`: fixed-width dependency waves expose scheduling across a DAG;
- `chain`: a serial dependency chain retained as a control, not as parallelism
  evidence.

`--classes-per-module` and `--methods-per-class` scale source volume independently
from module count. Every report records topology, layer width, source-file count,
and source-line count so unlike workloads are not silently compared.

The script writes raw JSON-lines samples, command logs, a JSON summary, and a
Markdown report under `target/benchmarks/competitors` by default.

```sh
scripts/benchmark-suite --topologies wide,layered --modules 40 --repeat 5 --include-gradle-daemon
```

Useful variants:

```sh
scripts/benchmark-suite --topology wide --modules 100 --repeat 7 --include-gradle-daemon
scripts/benchmark-suite --topology layered --layer-width 8 --modules 100 --repeat 7
scripts/benchmark-suite --topology chain --modules 40 --repeat 5
scripts/benchmark-suite --zolt ~/.zolt/bin/zolt
scripts/benchmark-suite --topology wide --generated-summary target/benchmarks/competitors/generated-java-workspace-wide/summary.json
scripts/benchmark-suite --real-projects spring-petclinic,apache-commons-cli --repeat 5
scripts/benchmark-suite --skip-generated --real-project netty --repeat 1 --real-project-sample-timeout 3600
scripts/benchmark-suite --skip-generated --real-project netty --repeat 3 --real-project-sample-timeout 3600
scripts/benchmark-suite --skip-generated --real-projects spring-petclinic,netty --real-project-dry-run
scripts/benchmark-competitors --topology wide --modules 200 --skip-maven --skip-gradle
```

The generated-lane script can still be used directly while debugging:

```sh
scripts/benchmark-competitors --topology wide --modules 40 --repeat 5 --include-gradle-daemon
```

After a direct generated-lane run, generate a suite-level summary:

```sh
scripts/benchmark-suite-summary \
  --summary target/benchmarks/competitors/summary.json \
  --output target/benchmarks/competitors/suite-summary.json
```

That writes:

- `summary-brief.md` for a deterministic suite summary;
- `suite-summary.json` as the stable contract for CI, artifacts, and model
  summarization;
- topology-specific lane detail files such as `generated-java-workspace-wide/`;
- `llm-summary.md` as a compatibility alias for the deterministic summary.

To generate a model summary locally:

```sh
OPENAI_API_KEY=... scripts/benchmark-openai-summary \
  --input target/benchmarks/competitors/suite-summary.json
```

Use `--dry-run` to write the request payload without calling the API.

No OpenAI call happens unless `OPENAI_API_KEY` is configured. CI still publishes
the deterministic summary when the key is absent.

## GitHub Actions

Use the manual `benchmarks` workflow for public runs. It installs or builds a
native Zolt binary, runs the suite harness, writes the deterministic compact summary
into the job summary, optionally appends a model-generated summary, and uploads
the report, raw samples, JSON summaries, prompt context, and command logs as
workflow artifacts.

To enable model-generated summaries in GitHub Actions, add a repository Actions
secret named `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Optional repository variables:

- `OPENAI_MODEL`, default `gpt-5.5`;
- `OPENAI_REASONING_EFFORT`, default `high`;
- `BENCHMARK_AI_SUMMARY=false` to disable the model step without removing the
  secret.

Use `zolt_source=release` for publishable comparisons. It installs the selected
release channel and avoids mixing Zolt build time into the benchmark setup. Use
`zolt_source=build` only when measuring the checked-out branch's native binary.
While this work is on the `benchmarks` branch, pushes to that branch build the
branch's native binary and run a 10-module, 1-repeat `wide` four-way smoke
benchmark without a model summary, plus one four-way repeat of every configured
real-project comparison. This makes the five pinned
adapters a branch merge gate without pretending a single sample is publishable.
Production-grade generated evidence remains an explicit manual run.
Manual runs default to 100 modules, 7 repeats, `wide,layered` topologies, all
five real-project comparisons, and Gradle daemon coverage.
For a Netty-only validation run, dispatch the workflow with
`skip_generated=true`, `real_projects=netty`, `repeat=1`, and
`real_project_sample_timeout=3600`.
That lane measures the same filtered Netty `common` main-source overlay with
Zolt, Maven, Gradle no-daemon, and Gradle daemon; native platform modules, the
rest of the reactor, and tests are explicitly omitted.

The workflow installs a pinned Gradle distribution directly instead of using
`gradle/actions/setup-gradle`. That keeps the GitHub summary dedicated to the
benchmark report and avoids unrelated Gradle action cache/build-scan summaries.
Uploaded real-project artifacts keep summaries, samples, and command logs, but
exclude the checked-out upstream source trees.
Adapter coverage under `benchmarks/adapters/` is included so real-project
comparisons carry their scope and omissions with the data.

## Specialist Lanes

The suite also preserves two focused manual comparisons that answer questions
the module-count lane cannot.

The large-source lane defaults to eight modules, 500 classes per module, and 30
methods per class: roughly half a million generated Java lines. It measures cold
dependency setup, warm no-op builds, implementation-only changes, public ABI
changes, full tests, and a selected downstream test for Zolt, Maven, and Gradle.

```sh
scripts/benchmark-large-source --zolt ~/.zolt/bin/zolt --repeat 3 --include-gradle-daemon
scripts/benchmark-large-source-report \
  target/benchmarks/large-source/large-source-compare-summary.jsonl
```

The Netty lane generates Zolt and Maven overlays from the same filtered pinned
Netty `common` Java sources, dependencies, and Java level. It is a controlled
source-subset comparison, not a full-reactor comparison. Package rows stay
separate because the two thin jars are not asserted to be byte-identical.

```sh
scripts/benchmark-netty-compare \
  --netty-dir /path/to/netty-at-bb2ff68 \
  --zolt ~/.zolt/bin/zolt \
  --repeat 3
```

Validate all benchmark contracts without doing a production-sized run:

```sh
scripts/benchmark-suite-test
scripts/benchmark-large-source-test
scripts/benchmark-large-source-report-test
scripts/benchmark-netty-compare-test
scripts/benchmark-real-project-test
```

## Real Projects

Generated workspaces are useful for controlled scaling evidence, but they are
not enough for public performance claims. Real-project benchmarks should use
pinned upstream commits plus Zolt adapters that build the same meaningful source
set. See [real-projects.md](./real-projects.md) for the project policy and
initial candidate suite.
`projects.json` is the machine-readable version used by the suite runner.

The real-project runner checks out a pinned commit and generates isolated Zolt,
Maven, Gradle no-daemon, and Gradle daemon overlays from the same checked-in
adapter contract:

```sh
scripts/benchmark-real-project --project spring-petclinic --repeat 5
scripts/benchmark-real-project --project apache-commons-cli --repeat 5
scripts/benchmark-real-project --project netty --repeat 3 --sample-timeout 3600
scripts/benchmark-real-project --project junit-framework --repeat 3
```

Those runs clone the pinned upstream commit into the benchmark output directory,
warm dependency caches outside the timed samples, and record clean compile,
warm no-op, and incremental source-change timings for all four modes. Each result
includes the adapter scope and omissions. The separate `benchmark-netty-compare`
runner remains a specialist lane with additional dependency and thin-package
rows for the same smaller `common` source subset.

## Publishing Results

When publishing benchmark evidence:

- include the generated `report.md`, `summary.json`, `suite-summary.json`, and
  `samples.jsonl`;
- include `summary-brief.md` and, when generated, `summary-ai.json` plus
  `summary-ai.md`;
- include tool versions, JDK version, OS, CPU architecture, module count,
  topology, source volume, and repeat count;
- keep the first clean build separate from repeated no-op, leaf-change, and
  root-change workflows;
- compare medians and keep raw samples available;
- say whether Gradle was measured with or without the daemon;
- avoid claims from machines with missing competitors, failed setup commands, or
  mixed cache states.

The README should stay conservative until this directory contains dated evidence
from a clean machine. A good public claim is specific: for example, "on this
machine, for this generated 100-module workspace, Zolt's median warm no-op build
was N ms versus Maven M ms and Gradle G ms."
