# Supply Chain (SBOM + Licenses) — Design Record

Status: decided 2026-07-22. Implementation contract for `zolt sbom`,
`zolt licenses`, the license policy gate, and publish attachment.

## Load-bearing fact

`zolt.lock` ALREADY stores the dependency graph edges: each `[[package]]`
carries `dependencies = ["g:a:v", ...]` written by
`LockfileAssembler.dependenciesFor` from the resolve graph, and `zolt tree` /
`zolt why` already reconstruct the full graph offline from exactly this field
(defensive lookup, cycle-guarded). Therefore the SBOM graph is a READ of the
lock — no re-resolution (rejected: needs warm cache/network, drags zolt-resolve
in, re-derives persisted data) and no lock schema change (rejected: a parallel
edge table duplicates existing data for zero new capability). Hashes
(jarSha256/artifactSha256) and per-member attribution (`members`) are also
already in the lock.

## Module placement

New workspace member `modules/zolt-sbom` (namespace sh.zolt.sbom), depending
on zolt-model + zolt-toml + zolt-repository. NOT zolt-policy (stays lean,
config-only) and NOT via zolt-resolve (EffectivePomMetadataLoader is
network-capable and doesn't carry licenses; a ~30-line cache-only parent walk
is leaner and makes offline structural). zolt-quality gains a dep on zolt-sbom
for the policy check; apps/zolt gains it for the commands.

## Determinism contract

- CycloneDX spec 1.5 (plain metadata.tools array; universally consumed by
  Dependency-Track/Grype/Trivy). Subset versioned in code: bomFormat,
  specVersion, serialNumber, version, metadata{timestamp?, tools[],
  component}, components[]{type, bom-ref, group, name, version, purl, scope,
  hashes[], licenses[]}, dependencies[]{ref, dependsOn[]}.
- serialNumber = urn:uuid:UUIDv5(fixed namespace UUID, seed), seed = the
  lock's projectResolutionFingerprint (fallback: root coordinate + sorted
  purls). Identical inputs → identical serial. Never random.
- metadata.timestamp OMITTED by default. Resolution: --timestamp <iso8601> →
  value; else SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH → that instant; else --timestamp now →
  wall clock (explicit opt-in); else omitted.
- Every collection sorted before emission (components by purl, dependsOn
  sorted, hashes fixed order, licenses by id/name). No hash-order iteration
  reaches output. Golden-file byte-equality tests enforce all of this.
- Hand-rolled JSON writer in sh.zolt.sbom.json (copy of the zolt-tree
  DependencyJsonFields pattern; it is package-private there). No external
  libraries.

## `zolt sbom`

`zolt sbom [--format cyclonedx] [--output <path>] [--workspace] [--offline]
[--include-test] [--include-provided] [--include-tools] [--include-dev]
[--timestamp ...]`. Missing zolt.lock → actionable "run zolt resolve".
Scope model: COMPILE/RUNTIME included by default as scope "required";
PROVIDED/DEV (--include-provided/--include-dev), TEST/TEST_PROCESSOR
(--include-test), PROCESSOR/TOOL_*/QUARKUS_DEPLOYMENT (--include-tools) as
"optional". Multi-scope packages dedup to one component (required wins);
edges filtered to surviving endpoints. purl = pkg:maven/g/a@v?type=<ext>
[&classifier=<c>] (classifier best-effort from artifact filename;
percent-encoded); bom-ref = purl. Root component from [project] +
[package.metadata] (license from config — authoritative, not POM-extracted);
type application when packaged as an app. metadata.tools = zolt + version.
Workspace = ONE BOM (per-member rejected: procurement consumes one artifact;
the graph expresses boundaries): root workspace component, members as library
components, external components deduped with member→external edges from the
lock's members field and external→external edges from dependencies.

## License engine (cache-only, no network — ever)

Additive zolt-repository change: RawPom gains List<RawPomLicense>
(name/url/distribution/comments), parsed by RawPomParser with the existing
hardened DOM helpers. PomLicenseResolver (zolt-sbom): read cached POM for each
in-scope package; if no <licenses>, walk <parent> coordinates through the
cache (nearest-ancestor wins, cycle-guarded); missing cached POM or empty
chain → UNKNOWN + one stderr warning suggesting `zolt resolve` (never fetch,
never fail the SBOM). Normalization via curated SpdxLicenseMapping keyed on
lowercased name AND url (Apache-2.0/MIT/BSD-2/BSD-3/EPL-1/EPL-2/LGPL/GPL
(+classpath)/CDDL/MPL-2.0/ISC/Unlicense/EDL spellings). Status per license:
SPDX (→ {"license":{"id"}}), UNMAPPED (raw name+url kept, flagged — never
guessed into a nearby id), UNKNOWN (component licenses omitted in SBOM,
surfaced in reports/policy). Dual licenses = N discrete objects, never an
SPDX expression (Maven semantics are ambiguous). No persisted memoization
(POMs are disk-cached; extraction is pure); in-process per-run memo only.

## `zolt licenses`

Text report grouped by license with per-dependency attribution and actionable
notes for UNKNOWN/UNMAPPED; `--format json` (Zolt-native schemaVersion 1
groups[] view); same scope flags as sbom. `--notices <path>` writes a
deterministic THIRD_PARTY notices file (coordinate — license (url) +
POM-derived attribution). Full license TEXT is NOT bundled in v1 (offline
guarantee + maintenance; v2 path: curated texts for top permissive ids).

## License policy

Config home `[dependencyPolicy.licenses]`: `allow = [...]`, `deny = [...]`,
`unknown = "fail"|"warn"|"allow"` (default warn — failing on UNKNOWN by
default would break most real projects; strict shops set fail in CI).
Precedence rule (one sentence, no ambiguity): permitted iff id ∉ deny AND
(allow empty OR id ∈ allow) — deny always wins; a non-empty allow-list is
authoritative. UNMAPPED matches by its raw string, otherwise follows the
unknown strictness. Model: DependencyPolicySettings gains
LicensePolicySettings (additive, back-compat overload). Codec: nested table
under the existing dependencyPolicy section with key validation. Enforcement:
new `zolt check` id `license-policy` (in IMPLEMENTED_CHECKS +
CI_CONTEXT_CHECKS), LicensePolicyQualityCheck in zolt-quality delegating to
zolt-sbom's evaluator; offline; failures name dependency, license, and the
policy line with a Next: (remove dep / policy exclude / amend policy).

## Publish attachment (flag-gated, off by default)

`zolt publish --sbom` adds a supplemental artifact with classifier
`cyclonedx`, extension `json` (`<artifact>-<version>-cyclonedx.json` — the
Central/CycloneDX-Maven-plugin convention; `.cdx.json` is a file-suffix
convention, not the Maven classifier form Central indexes). Rides the existing
supplemental planner: checksums + signing come free; bundle stays
byte-reproducible.

## Refusals

No vulnerability scanning (CI-side, owner-ratified). No license text bundling
v1. No network at sbom/licenses time. No SPDX document format v1 (CycloneDX
satisfies procurement; SPDX is a v2 --format on the same SbomModel).

## Stages

1 (S): zolt-sbom module + `zolt sbom` lock-only (components/hashes/edges/
purls/root/tools, no licenses). 2 (M): RawPom licenses + PomLicenseResolver +
SpdxLicenseMapping + licenses into SBOM + `zolt licenses` + --notices.
3 (S): policy model/codec/evaluator + license-policy check. 4 (S): workspace
one-BOM aggregation + publish --sbom. Registration checklist every stage:
ZoltCli, reflect-config (CliNativeReflectionConfigTest enforces), help-surface
fixture. Tests: golden-file byte-equality (incl. SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH invariance
and serial stability/sensitivity), POM fixtures (direct, parent-inherited,
dual, unmapped, absent), policy precedence + unknown strictness matrix, scope
dedup/edge filtering, workspace aggregation.

## Must-not-do

1. Non-determinism reaching the bytes (random serial, default wall-clock
   timestamp, hash-order iteration). 2. Network at sbom/licenses time — a
   missing POM is UNKNOWN, never a fetch. 3. License coercion or UNKNOWN
   hard-fail: unmapped stays raw and flagged; UNKNOWN is reported and
   policy-gated but never aborts SBOM generation.
