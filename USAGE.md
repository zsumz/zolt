# Zolt Usage Guide

Zolt is a Java build tool, not just a project generator. The smallest demo is
`zolt init && zolt test && zolt package`, but the current command surface also
covers dependency editing, reproducible resolution, workspaces, framework
packaging, generated sources, migration audits, quality gates, publishing, and
native release workflows.

## Start a Project

```sh
zolt init hello --group com.example --java 21
cd hello
zolt add com.google.guava:guava:33.4.0-jre
zolt add test org.junit.platform:junit-platform-console-standalone:1.11.4
zolt resolve
zolt test
zolt package
zolt run-package
```

Zolt writes a small `zolt.toml`, resolves a deterministic `zolt.lock`, compiles
sources, runs tests, and packages artifacts from the project model.

## Command Map

Common project commands:

```sh
zolt init NAME

zolt toolchain status --json
zolt toolchain sync
zolt toolchain install java 21 --graalvm --native-image
zolt toolchain list
zolt toolchain available
zolt exec -- java -version

zolt toolchain global use java 21 --graalvm --native-image
zolt toolchain sync --global
zolt toolchain status --global
zolt toolchain global unset
zolt shims install
zolt shims status
zolt shims uninstall
```

Workspace commands:

```sh
zolt init platform --workspace
zolt resolve --workspace
zolt build --workspace --all
zolt test --workspace --member apps/api
zolt package --workspace --members apps/api,tools
zolt run --workspace --member tools -- release-notes
zolt coverage --workspace --all
zolt check --workspace --context ci --all
zolt clean --workspace --all
```

Packaging, publishing, and release commands:

```sh
zolt package --mode thin
zolt package --mode spring-boot
zolt package --mode spring-boot-war
zolt package --mode quarkus
zolt package --mode uber
zolt package --plan --format json
zolt publish --dry-run
zolt publish --dry-run --sbom
zolt publish --context release
zolt sbom
zolt sbom --workspace --output sbom.json
zolt licenses
zolt licenses --format json
zolt licenses --notices THIRD_PARTY.txt
zolt native
zolt native --workspace --member apps/zolt
zolt release-archive --target linux-x64 --binary target/native/zolt
zolt release-index --channel-manifest channels/zap.json --output index.json
zolt release-verify dist/zolt-0.1.0-linux-x64.tar.gz
```

Uber-jar packaging merges runtime dependency classes into one archive. Duplicate
class entries fail the build by default; set `[package] uberDuplicates =
"first-wins"` to keep the first occurrence in the deterministic classpath order
instead (application output wins, then earlier dependencies) and report a per-jar
count of overridden entries. Uber jars that contain `META-INF/versions/` entries
are stamped `Multi-Release: true` automatically unless a `[package.manifest]`
entry sets that attribute explicitly.

```toml
[package]
mode = "uber"
uberDuplicates = "first-wins"
```

### Publishing to Maven repositories

`zolt publish` uploads the packaged artifact, a generated POM, and any
configured supplemental artifacts to a Maven-compatible repository. Configure
targets under `[publish]`, referencing `[repositoryCredentials]` for
authenticated repositories:

```toml
[publish]
releaseRepository = "company-releases"
snapshotRepository = "company-snapshots"

[publish.repositories.company-releases]
url = "https://repo.example.com/releases"
credentials = "company"

[publish.repositories.company-snapshots]
url = "https://repo.example.com/snapshots"
credentials = "company"
```

`zolt publish --dry-run` previews target routing, artifact evidence, the
generated POM, checksum sidecars, and any blockers without uploading anything.

Every uploaded file — the main artifact, each supplemental artifact, and the
POM — is accompanied by `.md5`, `.sha1`, and `.sha256` checksum sidecars, the
Maven repository standard for integrity verification. The sidecars contain the
bare lowercase hex digest and are listed in the `--dry-run` output.

Sources and Javadoc jars are produced by `zolt package` when enabled and are
published as supplemental artifacts with the standard `-sources.jar` and
`-javadoc.jar` classifiers:

```toml
[package]
sources = true
javadoc = true
```

The generated POM is enriched from `[package.metadata]`. Alongside `name`,
`description`, `url`, `license`, `developers`, `scm`, and `issues`, publish emits
`<packaging>` (derived from the package mode), a license `<url>`, richer SCM
elements, and structured developers with `<id>`, `<email>`, and `<organization>`:

```toml
[package.metadata]
name = "Example Library"
description = "A reusable Java library."
url = "https://example.com/library"
license = "Apache-2.0"
licenseUrl = "https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt"
scm = "https://github.com/example/library"
scmConnection = "scm:git:https://github.com/example/library.git"
scmDeveloperConnection = "scm:git:ssh://git@github.com/example/library.git"
scmTag = "v1.0.0"

[package.metadata.developer.ada]
name = "Ada Lovelace"
email = "ada@example.com"
organization = "Example Inc"
url = "https://example.com/ada"
```

`zolt publish --dry-run --central` reports Maven Central readiness: it checks the
release version, the required POM metadata (name, description, url, license
name+url, an identifiable developer, scm url+connection), the sources and Javadoc
jars, GPG signatures, and checksums, printing an actionable next step for each
unmet requirement. The check is opt-in, so it never blocks publishing to internal
repositories.

Enable `[publish.signing]` to attach a detached GPG signature (`.asc`) to every
uploaded artifact and to the POM. Publish shells out to the `gpg` binary
(`--batch --detach-sign --armor`); `keyId` selects the signing key and, when a key
requires a passphrase, `passphraseEnv` names an environment variable holding it —
the passphrase is fed to gpg over stdin, never the command line. Without
`passphraseEnv`, signing relies on `gpg-agent`. Secrets are referenced by
environment-variable name only:

```toml
[publish.signing]
enabled = true
keyId = "3AB1C2D3E4F5A6B7"
passphraseEnv = "ZOLT_SIGNING_PASSPHRASE"
```

To publish to Maven Central through the Sonatype Central Portal, configure
`[publish.central]`. `tokenEnv` names an environment variable holding the base64
`user:password` Portal user token (sent as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`);
`publishingType` is `user-managed` (validate and wait for a manual publish) or
`automatic` (publish once validated); `baseUrl` may point at an enterprise mirror:

```toml
[publish.central]
tokenEnv = "ZOLT_CENTRAL_TOKEN"
publishingType = "automatic"
```

`zolt publish --central` assembles a bundle in Maven repository layout — every
artifact and the POM with checksums and GPG signatures — uploads it to the
Portal, and reports the deployment id and status. It blocks unless every Maven
Central readiness requirement is satisfied. `zolt publish --dry-run --central`
assembles and lists the bundle locally and runs the readiness check without any
network access.

By default the upload returns as soon as the bundle is accepted. Add `--wait` to
poll the deployment until it reaches a terminal state and fail the command if it
does not publish. For `publishingType = "automatic"`, `--wait` returns once the
deployment is `PUBLISHED` (live on Maven Central) and errors on `FAILED`, quoting
the Portal's reported detail. For `publishingType = "user-managed"`, validation is
terminal: `--wait` returns once the deployment is `VALIDATED` and reminds you to
release it from the Portal. `--wait-timeout <seconds>` bounds the wait (default
`300`); on timeout the command errors with the deployment id so you can check its
progress later in the Central Portal.

### Publishing a BOM and a workspace family

A BOM (bill of materials) publishes a curated version set — workspace members at
their locked versions plus chosen third-party pins — as the platform other teams
import. Author it as a dedicated workspace member whose `zolt.toml` has a `[bom]`
section; the section's presence implies `[package].mode = "bom"`.

```toml
[project]
name = "platform-bom"
group = "com.acme.platform"
version = "1.4.0"

[bom]
members = true                 # every workspace member, or an explicit ["core", "http"] list

[bom.versions]                 # mirrors [versions]: fixed literals or { versionRef = "netty" }
"org.postgresql:postgresql" = "42.7.4"

[bom.imports]                  # mirrors [platforms]: emitted as <type>pom</type><scope>import</scope>
"com.fasterxml.jackson:jackson-bom" = { versionRef = "jackson" }
```

A BOM does not compile and has no jar: its artifact is the generated
`<dependencyManagement>` POM. `zolt build`/`package --workspace` skip its compile
wave and write `target/publish/<name>-<version>.pom` with package evidence.
Declaring dependencies, sources, javadoc, tests, or a manifest on a BOM is a
config error, and `zolt run`/`run-package` error actionably.

`zolt publish --workspace` publishes the whole family in one operation, using the
same per-member publication plan as a single-project publish. It runs an offline
Phase 1 first — per member it resolves config, projects a per-member lock,
generates and validates the POM (inter-member dependencies render at their locked
versions), plans every artifact (main jar, sources, javadoc, checksums, and
signatures), and checks readiness — aggregating every blocker into one report. If
anything is blocked, nothing uploads. Phase 2 then uploads each member's complete
artifact set: Maven Central receives one atomic family bundle (one deployment id),
while a plain repository receives a dependency-ordered sequential upload (providers
first, the BOM last) that authenticates every request with the repository's
configured `[repositoryCredentials]` and fails fast with an exact `--member` resume
command. Members publish at a uniform family version by default;
`--allow-mixed-versions` pins each member at its own version.

`--sbom` attaches a per-member CycloneDX SBOM (each jar member gets its own; the
BOM, having no resolved graph, gets none). `--central --wait` polls the family
deployment to a terminal state, honouring `--wait-timeout <seconds>`.

```sh
zolt publish --workspace --dry-run           # family Phase-1 preflight, no upload
zolt publish --workspace --sbom              # publish the family (+ per-member SBOMs)
zolt publish --workspace --central --wait    # one atomic Central bundle, then poll
zolt check --workspace --context ci --require-publish-dry-run   # CI gate
```

Consumers import the BOM through `[platforms]` and declare its members
version-less:

```toml
[platforms]
"com.acme.platform:acme-bom" = "1.4.0"

[dependencies]
"com.acme:acme-http" = {}     # version supplied by the imported BOM
```

`zolt sbom` on a BOM emits a metadata-only CycloneDX document (a BOM has no
resolved dependency graph) with a note on stderr, never an error. `zolt explain`
detects an existing Maven `dependencyManagement` BOM (`maven.bom.detected`) or a
Gradle `java-platform` project (`gradle.bom.detected`) and `zolt explain
--emit-toml` drafts a `[bom]` member from it, routing import-scope BOMs /
`platform(...)` imports to `[bom.imports]` and plain pins / `constraints { }` to
`[bom.versions]`.

Migration and integration commands:

```sh
zolt explain --source auto
zolt explain --source gradle --scorecard
zolt explain --source maven --blockers
zolt explain --emit-toml
zolt explain --emit-toml-output target/zolt-migration
zolt ide model --format json
zolt ide model --workspace --format json
zolt quarkus plan
zolt quarkus test-plan
```

Self-management commands for installer-managed native Zolt versions:

```sh
zolt self releases --channel zap
zolt self install VERSION --channel zap
zolt self exec VERSION -- version
zolt self prune --keep 3 --dry-run
zolt self update
```

## Project Configuration

A minimal project declares a Java package model, repositories, dependencies, and
source roots:

```toml
[project]
name = "hello-zolt"
version = "0.1.0"
group = "com.example"
java = "21"
main = "com.example.Main"

[repositories]
central = "https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2"

[dependencies]
"com.google.guava:guava" = "33.4.0-jre"

[test.dependencies]
"org.junit.platform:junit-platform-console-standalone" = "1.11.4"

[build]
source = "src/main/java"
test = "src/test/java"
output = "target/classes"
testOutput = "target/test-classes"
```

Dependencies can be split by usage:

```toml
[dependencies]
"org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-webmvc" = {}

[runtime.dependencies]
"com.h2database:h2" = {}

[provided.dependencies]
"jakarta.servlet:jakarta.servlet-api" = {}

[dev.dependencies]
"org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-devtools" = {}

[annotationProcessors]
"org.projectlombok:lombok" = {}

[test.dependencies]
"org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter" = "5.11.4"

[test.annotationProcessors]
"org.projectlombok:lombok" = {}
```

Version aliases, BOM/platform imports, exclusions, and constraints are first
class:

```toml
[versions]
spring = "4.0.6"

[platforms]
"org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-dependencies" = { versionRef = "spring" }

[dependencies]
"org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-webmvc" = { exclusions = [
  { group = "org.apache.tomcat.embed", artifact = "tomcat-embed-core" }
] }
# classifier and type select a specific published artifact for a coordinate and
# are independent; both work in every dependency scope, with or without a
# version or platform-managed version.
"io.netty:netty-transport-native-epoll" = { version = "4.1.100.Final", classifier = "linux-x86_64" }

[dependencyPolicy]
exclude = [
  { group = "commons-logging", artifact = "commons-logging", reason = "Use Spring JCL and SLF4J bridges" }
]

[dependencyConstraints]
"org.apache.tomcat.embed:tomcat-embed-core" = { version = "11.0.21", kind = "strict", reason = "Servlet baseline" }
```

## Resolution and Lockfile Contracts

Zolt deliberately documents the parts of resolution that Maven leaves
ambient or historically shaped:

- Version conflicts use direct-preference plus newest-wins mediation, not
  Maven nearest-wins. Every mediation is recorded in `zolt.lock` as a
  `[[conflict]]` entry.
- Dynamic versions, version ranges, external SNAPSHOT dependencies, system
  scope, and uninterpolated `${...}` versions at point of use are rejected
  instead of resolved dynamically.
- Repositories are tried in alphabetical order of repository id because TOML
  table order is not a contract. The `source` recorded in `zolt.lock` makes
  the selected repository id part of the lockfile contract.
- Integrity is lockfile-pinned. Zolt records the SHA-256 of each fetched POM
  and JAR and verifies cached/build inputs against those lockfile hashes.
  Repository checksum sidecars are not fetched; the first download trusts the
  repository TLS channel.
- `zolt.lock` version 1 is deterministic: no timestamps, no absolute paths,
  stable ordering, and LF line endings. Older lockfile versions should be
  regenerated with the current Zolt; newer lockfile versions require a newer
  Zolt before `zolt resolve --locked` can verify them.
- `zolt add`, `zolt remove`, and `zolt platform` rewrite `zolt.toml`. They
  warn before rewriting a file that contains comments because comments and
  custom formatting may be removed.
- `[publish]` is active project configuration for `zolt publish --dry-run`
  and uploads, and can reference `[repositoryCredentials]` entries for
  authenticated repositories.
- Version discovery is advisory-only. `maven-metadata.xml` is fetched only by
  `zolt outdated` and `zolt update`. Resolution — `zolt resolve`, `zolt resolve
  --locked`, `build`/`test`/`package`, workspace resolve, and `zolt explain
  verify` — never fetches, reads, or is influenced by version listings, and
  `zolt.lock` never records one. A discovered version enters a build only when
  written as a fixed literal into `zolt.toml` and re-resolved. This is enforced
  structurally (the resolve layer has no dependency on the discovery layer) and
  by a test asserting a resolve issues zero `maven-metadata.xml` requests.

### SNAPSHOT dependencies

A directly declared `-SNAPSHOT` dependency version — in `[dependencies]` and
every other dependency section, including `runtime`/`provided`/`dev`/`test`
dependencies and `annotationProcessors` — parses in `zolt.toml` and is decided
at resolve time rather than rejected while parsing, so the resolve layer is the
single authority on whether a SNAPSHOT is supported (`zolt add
group:artifact:1.0-SNAPSHOT` writes the declaration and lets resolve decide).
SNAPSHOTs are rejected by default because a moving version breaks the
reproducibility that `zolt.lock` promises. Two narrow exceptions are allowed
because they name artifacts that already exist on this machine rather than a
remote moving target: workspace-member coordinates a sibling depends on with
`{ workspace = "path" }` (built from source and locked with `source =
"workspace"`), and artifacts present in an enabled maven-local repository
overlay (`zolt resolve --repository-overlay maven-local`), which are SHA-256
pinned in `zolt.lock` with `source = "local-overlay:maven-local"` just like any
materialized artifact. Everything else — remote SNAPSHOT feeds,
`maven-metadata.xml`, and timestamped-snapshot resolution — stays unsupported by
design; a SNAPSHOT that is neither a workspace member nor present in an enabled
overlay is rejected at resolve time with guidance (from `zolt resolve`, `zolt
resolve --locked`, and `zolt explain verify`) rather than fetched from the
network. `[platforms]` and `[dependencyConstraints]` continue to reject
SNAPSHOTs while parsing.

## Dependency Updates

`zolt outdated` and `zolt update` are the only commands that consult remote
version listings (`maven-metadata.xml`). Discovery is advisory: it never changes
a build until a chosen version is written into `zolt.toml` and re-resolved.
SNAPSHOT versions are never suggested, ranges are never written, and toolchain
JDK versions are out of scope.

Listings are fetched from the same repositories, in the same
alphabetical-by-id order that resolution uses, and unioned across them (a
candidate's source is the first repository in that order that lists it). Version
comparison and stability are Zolt's own rules: a version is a prerelease only
when it carries a known qualifier (`alpha`/`a`, `beta`/`b`, `milestone`/`m`,
`rc`/`cr`, `ea`, `preview`, `dev`, `nightly`, `canary`, `pre`, `experimental`);
unknown qualifiers such as `-jre`, `-android`, `-incubating`, or calendar
versions are treated as releases. Listings live in a cache namespace kept separate from
the immutable artifact cache; online runs always refetch, falling back to the
cache with a staleness note only when a fetch fails, while `--offline` consults
the cache only.

### `zolt outdated`

Reports available updates for every version surface in `zolt.toml`: `[versions]`
aliases (with the coordinates each alias `governs`), literal-versioned
dependencies in every scope, `[platforms]`, `[annotationProcessors]` and their
test variants, `[dependencyConstraints]`, and `[generated.execTools]` /
protobuf / openapi tool coordinates. A versionRef-backed entry reports under its
alias rather than twice; SNAPSHOT literals and workspace-member dependencies are
ignored. Candidates are grouped by change class (patch, minor, major) with a
selected in-major target and a latest target. Run at a workspace root it reports
one block per member and notes coordinates shared across members.

Flags: `--format text|json` (JSON is schema v1 with stable keys and explicit
nulls), `--include-prereleases`, `--all` (also show up-to-date surfaces),
`--offline`, and optional selectors (a coordinate, alias, or section token).

    zolt outdated
    zolt outdated --format json
    zolt outdated --include-prereleases com.google.guava:guava

### `zolt update`

**Breaking change:** `zolt update` no longer updates the Zolt binary. It was
repurposed to update dependency versions in `zolt.toml`; binary self-update now
lives at `zolt self update`. See [Breaking changes](docs/breaking-changes.md).

The top-level `update` command writes version updates into `zolt.toml` using the
same discovery; binary self-update stays at `zolt self update`. By default it
moves each surface to the latest stable version within its current major;
`--latest` allows a major bump and `--patch`/`--minor`/`--major` set the
ceiling. `--include-prereleases` widens candidates (never to a SNAPSHOT), and
selectors scope which surfaces update.

Edits use only Zolt's existing mutation machinery and preserve dependency
metadata (exclusions, classifier, type, optional): a `[versions]` alias is the
primary lever, and updating one always warns with the full fan-out of
coordinates it changes; a versionRef-backed coordinate never has a literal
written over it. Literal exec-tool coordinate mutation is deferred, so those
surfaces are reported as skipped. `--dry-run` prints the semantic edit list (the
TOML writer re-serializes whole files, so text diffs are noise) and writes
nothing; `--format json` emits `edits[]`/`skipped[]`. After a successful write,
`zolt resolve` runs by default to keep `zolt.lock` consistent (`--no-resolve`
opts out), and a file containing comments is warned about before it is
rewritten.

    zolt update --dry-run
    zolt update --latest
    zolt update --minor com.example:lib

## Java Toolchains

Zolt can run `java`, `javac`, `jar`, and GraalVM `native-image` from a concrete
managed JDK instead of whatever happens to be on `PATH`.

Project-pinned toolchains are declared in `zolt.toml` and locked in `zolt.lock`:

```toml
[project]
java = "21"

[toolchain.java]
version = "21"
distribution = "graalvm-community"
features = ["native-image"]
policy = "prefer-managed"
```

Use `temurin` for JVM-only work, or `graalvm-community` with
`features = ["native-image"]` for native builds. Supported policies are:

- `prefer-managed`: use the Zolt-managed JDK when installed, but allow a
  matching system JDK.
- `require-managed`: never use ambient `JAVA_HOME` or `PATH`.
- `allow-system`: prefer a matching ambient JDK.

Sync installs the managed JDK into the default user store and writes stable
multi-platform toolchain metadata:

```sh
zolt toolchain install java 21 --graalvm --native-image
zolt toolchain sync
zolt toolchain list
zolt toolchain available
zolt toolchain status
zolt toolchain status --json
```

Use `zolt toolchain install java ...` when you want a managed Java version
available without first creating a project config. It installs into the same
shared user store and writes reusable global lock metadata, but it does not
change the global default. `zolt toolchain list` shows the active project or
global selection, lock entries, and installed catalog entries. `zolt toolchain
available` shows the bundled Temurin and GraalVM catalog matrix.

`zolt.lock` records the supported target matrix, so a macOS developer and Linux
CI do not rewrite the lock back and forth. The install itself stays local to the
machine under `~/.zolt/toolchains`; only the current host's archive is downloaded
when it is missing. Managed downloads are pinned to exact artifact URLs and
verified with SHA-256 checksums from the lock.

### Test-runtime toolchain

`javac --release N` guarantees your code only calls APIs that exist in Java N, but
`zolt test` still executes on the build toolchain — so a project that targets 17
while building on 21 never proves its code actually *runs* on 17. Pin a test-runtime
toolchain to close that gap: `--release` catches API misuse at compile time, and
running the tests on the target JRE catches everything else, completing the
cross-version story.

```toml
[project]
java = "17"

[toolchain.java]
version = "21"
distribution = "temurin"

[toolchain.java.test]
version = "17"
# distribution = "temurin"   # optional; defaults to [toolchain.java].distribution
```

`[toolchain.java.test]` sets its own `version` (and optional `distribution`),
inheriting `features` and `policy` from `[toolchain.java]`. It resolves, installs,
and locks through the same managed-toolchain machinery: `zolt toolchain sync`
installs it beside the build toolchain, `zolt toolchain status` and `zolt toolchain
list` show it, and it is recorded as an additive `[[toolchain.java]]` entry in
`zolt.lock` in the same per-platform, SHA-256-pinned format. An equal-version test
entry deduplicates against the main entry, so it neither grows the lock nor triggers
a second download.

When declared, `zolt test`, `zolt coverage`, and `zolt integration-test` compile on
the build toolchain but **run** the tests on the test-runtime JDK (the Jacoco agent
attaches on that JRE too). Without the section, tests run on the build toolchain and
nothing changes. Zolt rejects a test-runtime version older than `[project].java`
(it would fail with `UnsupportedClassVersionError`) and, when the toolchain is not
installed, points you at `zolt toolchain sync` — both surfaced by `zolt plan
--target test` and `zolt doctor`. Integration tests are the strongest use case:
exercise your build on the JDK your users actually run.

Build, run, test, package, and native commands use the resolved toolchain
automatically. `zolt exec -- ...` runs an arbitrary command with `JAVA_HOME` and
`PATH` pointed at the resolved JDK:

```sh
zolt exec -- java -version
zolt exec -- native-image --version
```

User global Java is a default, not a project override. Store it in
`~/.zolt/config.toml` with `[defaults.toolchain.java]`, or use the CLI:

```sh
zolt toolchain global use java 21 --temurin
zolt toolchain sync --global
zolt toolchain status --global
zolt exec --global -- java -version
```

When a project declares `[toolchain.java]`, project config wins. Outside a Zolt
project, `zolt exec -- java -version` can use the global default. Global lock
metadata lives beside the user config in `~/.zolt/global-toolchains.lock`, while
installed JDKs are shared in `~/.zolt/toolchains`.

Shell-global Java is opt-in through shims:

```sh
zolt shims install
export PATH="$HOME/.zolt/shims:$PATH"
java -version
```

The shims are small wrapper scripts for `java`, `javac`, `jar`, `javadoc`,
`jshell`, and `native-image`. Each wrapper calls `zolt exec -- <tool> ...`, so a
project toolchain still wins inside a Zolt project and the global default is
used outside one. Zolt does not edit shell profiles automatically.

## Enterprise Networks

Zolt runs behind corporate proxies, TLS-intercepting firewalls, and internal
mirrors. All of this is *transport* configuration: it changes how bytes are
fetched, never what is resolved, so it never affects `zolt.lock` or build
fingerprints. Machine-level settings live in `~/.zolt/config.toml` and
environment variables, never in the committed `zolt.toml`.

### HTTP(S) proxies

Zolt honors the standard proxy environment variables for both artifact
downloads and Java toolchain downloads:

```sh
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.corp.example:8080
export HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.corp.example:8080
export NO_PROXY=.internal.example,localhost,127.0.0.1
```

Lowercase names (`https_proxy`, `http_proxy`, `no_proxy`) are also read and take
precedence over the uppercase forms. Java's built-in HTTP client ignores these
variables, so Zolt bridges them itself. The conventional Java system properties
are honored as a fallback when the matching environment variable is unset:

```sh
zolt resolve -Dhttps.proxyHost=proxy.corp.example -Dhttps.proxyPort=8080 \
  -Dhttp.nonProxyHosts='*.internal.example|localhost'
```

Precedence, per setting: environment variable first, then the Java system
property. `NO_PROXY`/`no_proxy` (falling back to `http.nonProxyHosts`) supports
exact hosts and domain-suffix matches — `example.com` and `.example.com` both
match `example.com` and `repo.example.com` — and `*` bypasses the proxy for
every host.

### Authenticated proxies

If your proxy requires HTTP Basic authentication, embed the credentials in the
proxy URL's userinfo. Zolt parses them and answers a `407 Proxy Authentication
Required` challenge with a `Proxy-Authorization` header — they are never silently
dropped:

```sh
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://alice:s3cr3t@proxy.corp.example:8080
```

Percent-encode any special characters in the password (`@` as `%40`, `:` as
`%3A`, and so on). The conventional `http.proxyUser`/`http.proxyPassword` (and
`https.*`) system properties are honored as a fallback when the proxy URL carries
no userinfo. Credentials are scoped to the proxy endpoint they are declared with
and are never offered to an origin server.

HTTP-origin downloads through an authenticating proxy work unconditionally. For
HTTPS origins the JDK opens a `CONNECT` tunnel and, by default, disables Basic
authentication on tunnels via `jdk.http.auth.tunneling.disabledSchemes`. When —
and only when — proxy credentials are configured, Zolt clears `Basic` from that
property before it builds its first HTTP client, so tunneled Basic auth works.
The JDK reads that property once per process; in the rare case another client was
already initialized, Zolt prints a one-time warning rather than failing silently,
and you can force the behavior yourself:

```sh
zolt resolve -Djdk.http.auth.tunneling.disabledSchemes=
```

### Custom CA trust

To trust a corporate TLS-interception root (or any private CA), point Zolt at a
PEM bundle of one or more certificates. Zolt *augments* the JDK default trust
store with these anchors, so public TLS keeps working alongside the corporate
root. Configure it in user-global config:

```toml
# ~/.zolt/config.toml
version = 1

[network]
caBundle = "~/.zolt/corp-ca.pem"
```

or override per invocation with an environment variable, which wins over the
config file:

```sh
export ZOLT_CA_BUNDLE=/etc/pki/tls/certs/corp-ca.pem
```

Machine-level trust belongs in user-global config or the environment, not in a
project's `zolt.toml`.

### Bearer / personal access token authentication

Repository credentials are referenced by environment-variable *name* only;
secret values are never stored in or read from config, and never written to
`zolt.lock` or command output. Alongside HTTP Basic (`usernameEnv` +
`passwordEnv`), a credential may use a bearer token / PAT via `tokenEnv`, which
sends `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on both downloads and publish uploads:

```toml
# zolt.toml
[repositories]
company = { url = "https://nexus.example.com/repository/maven", credentials = "company" }

[repositoryCredentials.company]
tokenEnv = "COMPANY_ARTIFACT_TOKEN"
```

`tokenEnv` is mutually exclusive with `usernameEnv`/`passwordEnv`; setting both
is a configuration error. Credentialed remote repositories must use HTTPS.

### Java toolchain mirrors

Zolt's bundled JDK catalog downloads from `github.com`. To route those downloads
through an internal mirror, set a mirror base that replaces the `github.com`
prefix. Configure it in user-global config:

```toml
# ~/.zolt/config.toml
[network]
toolchainMirror = "https://nexus.example.com/github"
```

or override with an environment variable, which wins over the config file:

```sh
export ZOLT_TOOLCHAIN_MIRROR=https://nexus.example.com/github
```

A GraalVM archive normally fetched from
`https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-ce-builds/releases/download/...` is then
fetched from `https://nexus.example.com/github/graalvm/graalvm-ce-builds/...`.
The pinned SHA-256 from the toolchain lock is still verified against the
mirrored bytes, and the lock keeps the canonical upstream URL, so mirroring is
transparent to reproducibility. When a toolchain download fails with a network
error, the remediation names the proxy, CA, and mirror options above.

## Build Cache

Zolt fingerprints every module's compile inputs to skip recompilation when
nothing changed. That skip-gate is local: a clean checkout or a wiped `target/`
always recompiles. The build cache stores the compiled output keyed by those
same fingerprints, so a wiped or fresh checkout **restores** the classes instead
of recompiling them. It is opt-in and content-addressed.

Correctness beats hit rate: the cache is keyed on everything that determines the
compiled bytes, and any doubt is a miss that rebuilds. Every entry is verified
against its sidecar — requested key, scope, declared size, and archive SHA-256 —
before any output is touched, and a restore that cannot be fully verified is a
miss that rebuilds. A *verified* cache hit reproduces the bytes a compile would
produce. That guarantee holds against corruption and mismatched entries; for a
shared remote cache, the trust model below sets out what it does and does not
defend against.

### Enabling it

The build cache is a machine concern, like proxy and CA settings — it never
affects `zolt.lock` or what gets built, so it lives in `~/.zolt/config.toml`, not
in a committed `zolt.toml` (a `[buildCache]` table in a project `zolt.toml` is
rejected). It is disabled by default.

```toml
# ~/.zolt/config.toml
version = 1

[buildCache]
enabled = true
# Optional. Defaults to ~/.zolt/build-cache.
dir = "~/.zolt/build-cache"
# Optional cap in megabytes; the cache is pruned (least-recently-used) to fit.
# Defaults to 2048.
maxSizeMb = 2048
```

When enabled, `zolt build`, `zolt test`, and `zolt package` restore a module's
compiled classes on a fingerprint miss and store them after a real compile. In a
workspace each member is cached independently. Restores are reported distinctly:

```text
✔ Restored 80 main classes · build cache
```

Pass `--no-build-cache` to any of those commands to bypass the cache for one run
(neither restore nor store). `--timings` records the per-module cache outcome
(`restored`, `stored`, or `uncacheable`).

### Inspecting and pruning

```sh
zolt cache status              # location, entry count, size, and cap
zolt cache prune               # evict least-recently-used entries to the cap
zolt cache prune --max-size-mb 512   # prune to a smaller cap for this run
```

The cache also auto-prunes opportunistically after a store when it exceeds the
cap.

### Remote cache

A remote HTTP endpoint lets a team or CI share compiled output. It is dumb HTTP —
`GET <url>/<key>` reads a blob (404 is a miss), `PUT <url>/<key>` writes one — so
any Artifactory or Nexus generic repository works. On a local miss Zolt fetches
from the remote, verifies the blob, copies it into the local cache, and restores
from there. Reads are the default; pushing is opt-in, so developers populate from
the shared cache while CI writes to it.

```toml
# ~/.zolt/config.toml
version = 1

[buildCache]
enabled = true

[buildCache.remote]
url = "https://nexus.example.com/repository/zolt-build-cache"
credentials = "buildCache"   # optional; names a [repositoryCredentials] block
push = false                 # devs read; set true (or ZOLT_BUILD_CACHE_PUSH=1) on CI

# Credential definitions may live in user-global config for machine/CI use. Only
# environment-variable *names* are stored — never secret values.
[repositoryCredentials.buildCache]
tokenEnv = "ZOLT_BUILD_CACHE_TOKEN"   # bearer; or usernameEnv + passwordEnv for basic
```

Auth reuses the repository credential model: `tokenEnv` sends
`Authorization: Bearer <token>`, and `usernameEnv`/`passwordEnv` send HTTP Basic.
A credentialed remote must use HTTPS. Set `push = true` in config or export
`ZOLT_BUILD_CACHE_PUSH=1` for one run (the typical CI setup).

The remote never fails a build. A read problem is a miss that rebuilds; an upload
problem is a warning and the build continues; an unauthorized (`401`/`403`) push
surfaces one actionable warning per build. `--offline` drops the remote tier
entirely while the local cache keeps serving.

### Cache integrity and trust model

The remote cache is **trusted build infrastructure**, not a public download. Its
integrity checks defend against corruption and mismatched entries — a truncated
blob, a torn upload, a sidecar that names a different key — but they are **not** a
defense against a party with malicious write access to the cache. Operate a shared
cache accordingly: restrict write access to CI, treat entries as immutable
(content-addressed keys never change meaning), and serve reads over HTTPS.

Within that model every restore is defended before it can affect a build:

- **Bounded download.** The archive and its sidecar stream to temporary files
  under hard size caps (the sidecar a small fixed cap; the archive the configured
  `maxSizeMb`, or 512 MB when the cache is uncapped). A body that exceeds its cap
  is aborted and treated as a miss, so the client never buffers an unbounded blob.
- **Full identity check.** Before any output is touched, the sidecar must match
  the requested entry on every axis — key, scope, declared size, and archive
  SHA-256. Any mismatch is a miss that deletes the local copy and logs one warning
  naming what failed.
- **Bounded, transactional extraction.** The archive is extracted into a sibling
  staging directory under entry-count, per-entry, and total-decompressed-size
  limits (so a "zip bomb" aborts) and with a path-traversal guard, then swapped
  into place atomically. A failure at any point leaves the previous output exactly
  as it was — never partial — so the build proceeds as a clean miss and recompiles.

Because the SHA sidecar is served by the same remote as the archive, it detects
corruption, not tampering: a writer who can replace the archive can replace the
sidecar too. That is why write access is the security boundary for a shared cache.

**Planned — signed entries.** A future opt-in `hmacKeyEnv` under
`[buildCache.remote]` will name an environment variable holding a shared secret;
producers HMAC the sidecar (metadata and SHA) at store time and consumers verify
it at restore, adding tamper-evidence on top of the integrity checks for caches
whose write access cannot be fully trusted. Following the credential convention,
only the env-var *name* is stored, never the secret. This is not yet implemented;
until it ships, rely on restricting write access.

### The key, and the JDK

The cache key is the inputs-only compile fingerprint (sources, classpath,
compiler settings, generated sources, resources — everything except the expected
output classes) plus the compile scope and the resolved JDK identity. The JDK is
part of the key because `javac` can emit different bytecode across JDK majors even
for the same `--release`; the on-disk skip-gate does not need it, but a shared
cache does. Classpath dependencies contribute a content hash of their compiled
bytes (not their location), so a build keys identically whether a dependency was
itself compiled or restored, and regardless of where artifacts live on disk.

### Incremental state (v1 tradeoff)

Zolt's warm incremental compiler keeps machine-local state files
(`.zolt-incremental-*.state`) that record per-source ownership using absolute
paths. Those are never cached. A restored module therefore has no incremental
state: the skip-gate works immediately (a no-op rebuild still skips), but the
**next source edit does one full recompile**, which re-establishes incremental
state and re-stores the cache entry. Subsequent edits are incremental as usual.
The build cache is aimed at clean and CI builds; warm incremental development
stays entirely local, and the cache is not consulted while incremental state is
present.

### What is never cached

A module whose output is not a pure function of its hashed inputs is excluded
from the cache entirely (store and restore). Today that means any module with a
`cache = "none"` exec generated-source step: such a step runs against an oracle
Zolt cannot hash (a live database, a clock, the network), so its output is not
reproducible. Over-approximating this taint is the safe direction.

## Workspaces

Workspace roots describe member projects and default selections:

```toml
[workspace]
name = "workspace-app"
members = ["apps/api", "modules/core", "tools"]
defaultMembers = ["apps/api"]

[repositories]
central = "https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2"

[commands.tasks.release-notes]
description = "Run the Java tools member release-notes command"
cmd = ["zolt", "run", "--workspace", "--member", "tools", "--", "release-notes"]
```

Workspace commands resolve one root lockfile and run selected members in
dependency order.

## Tests and Coverage

Zolt runs JUnit Platform based tests and can compile Java and Groovy test
sources when configured. That covers examples such as JUnit Jupiter, JUnit
Vintage, and Spock:

```toml
[test.dependencies]
"org.apache.groovy:groovy" = "4.0.22"
"org.spockframework:spock-core" = "2.3-groovy-4.0"
"org.junit.platform:junit-platform-console-standalone" = "1.11.4"

[test.sources]
groovy = ["src/test/groovy"]
```

Test commands support class/method selection, glob patterns, JUnit tags, JVM
arguments, XML reports, deterministic shards, named suites, and optional profile
history used for shard balancing.

### Coverage Floors

A `[coverage]` section declares the minimum Jacoco coverage a project accepts.
Each floor is an optional percentage (`0`–`100`); omit a metric to leave it
ungated:

```toml
[coverage]
minLine = 88.0
minBranch = 74.0
# minInstruction and minMethod are also supported.
```

After `zolt coverage` writes its report, floors are checked against the report's
totals; any metric below its floor fails the command with a non-zero exit and an
actionable message naming the metric, its actual coverage, and the floor. With no
`[coverage]` section, coverage behavior is unchanged. `zolt check --context ci`
applies the same floors when a `jacoco.xml` report is present under the coverage
directory. In a workspace, floors in the root `zolt.toml` gate the aggregate
`zolt coverage --workspace --all` report, while a member's own `[coverage]`
governs that member's solo `zolt coverage` run.

## Frameworks and Generated Sources

Zolt has project-model support for common Java application shapes:

- Spring Boot web applications, executable jars, WAR-style packaging, build
  metadata, resources, and Spring Boot package modes.
- Quarkus fast-jar packaging and Quarkus augmentation/test plan inspection when
  `[framework.quarkus]` is enabled.
- Micronaut-style annotation processor workflows.
- Vert.x applications with platform BOMs and dependency exclusions.
- OpenAPI generated Java sources with tool versioning and presets.
- Protobuf/gRPC generated Java sources.
- Generic exec steps that run a pinned tool — a resolver-locked `jvm` tool, a
  PATH `process` tool, or the member's own `project` classpath — to produce Java
  sources or resources consumed by the build.
- Library-style canaries such as Commons CLI, HikariCP, and SLF4J workspace
  modules.

Generated-source configuration can look like this:

```toml
[generated.openapiTool]
coordinate = "org.openapitools:openapi-generator-cli"
version = "7.11.0"

[generated.openapiPresets.spring-api]
generator = "spring"
library = "spring-boot"
apiPackage = "com.example.generated.api"
modelPackage = "com.example.generated.model"
invokerPackage = "com.example.generated"

[generated.main.public-api]
kind = "openapi"
language = "java"
input = "src/main/openapi/public-api.yaml"
output = "target/generated/sources/openapi/public-api"
preset = "spring-api"
```

Protobuf/gRPC configuration can look like this:

```toml
[versions]
protobuf = "4.28.3"
grpc = "1.68.1"

[generated.protobufTool]
protocCoordinate = "com.google.protobuf:protobuf-java"
protocVersionRef = "protobuf"
grpcPluginCoordinate = "io.grpc:grpc-api"
grpcPluginVersionRef = "grpc"

[generated.main.greeter]
kind = "protobuf"
language = "java"
inputs = ["src/main/proto/greeter.proto"]
output = "target/generated/sources/protobuf"
```

### Exec Steps

An exec step runs a pinned tool on declared inputs to produce one owned output
that the build consumes — the same reproducible machinery as OpenAPI/protobuf,
with the tool identity lifted into configuration. A named tool under
`[generated.execTools.<name>]` (stage 1: `runner = "jvm"`) resolves its
`coordinates` into the locked `tool-exec` scope, never onto application
classpaths, and Zolt launches `<managed java> -cp <locked jars> <mainClass>
<args>` in a sandboxed working directory with a curated environment.

```toml
[versions]
jooq = "3.19.15"
postgres = "42.7.4"

[generated.execTools.jooq]
runner = "jvm"
coordinates = [
    { coordinate = "org.jooq:jooq-codegen", versionRef = "jooq" },
    { coordinate = "org.postgresql:postgresql", versionRef = "postgres" },
]
mainClass = "org.jooq.codegen.GenerationTool"

[generated.main.jooq-model]
kind = "exec"
tool = "jooq"
args = ["src/main/jooq/config.xml"]
inputs = ["src/main/jooq/config.xml", "src/main/resources/db/schema.sql"]
output = "target/generated/sources/jooq"
produces = "java-sources"          # or "resources", with into = "static"
cache = "content"                  # default (only value in stage 1)
```

A step's position is derived entirely from its declared IO — there is no
anchor, `after`, or `dependsOn`. `produces = "java-sources"` (or
`"test-sources"`) joins that scope's compile source roots; `produces =
"resources"` joins resource copying, optionally under an `into` subtree. An
input equal to or under another exec step's declared output creates an ordering
edge; steps run serially in the topological order of those edges, with ties
broken alphabetically by id, and a cycle is a configuration error.

Determinism follows the OpenAPI cache: an exec step re-runs only when its
fingerprint changes — locked tool jar hashes, argv, the content of its expanded
inputs, its literal `env`, and produces/into — and its output bytes are hashed
into the module build fingerprint so a changed output invalidates exactly its
consumers. `args` is an argv array Zolt never interprets as a shell string, and
every declared path is real-path-contained under the project root. `zolt plan`
shows each step's derived position, tool identity, inputs/outputs, and cache
policy, and `zolt check` validates the steps.

Beyond the resolver-locked `jvm` runner, a tool can run a PATH binary. A
`process` tool runs a `binary` discovered on the curated PATH; because PATH
bytes are unprovable it must set `allowUnpinnedTool = true`, and its identity in
the fingerprint is the binary name plus the probed `versionCommand` stdout (an
optional `versionExpect` semver range fails fast on a wrong version). `cwd`
sandboxes the working directory, `timeoutSeconds` bounds the run (default 600),
and `secretEnv` injects a value read from a named ambient variable at run time
without ever writing that value to config, the lockfile, fingerprints, or logs.

Because Zolt never reads a secret's value into the content fingerprint, a step
that declares `secretEnv` cannot use the default `cache = "content"` — a changed
secret would otherwise silently reuse stale output. Zolt rejects that
combination and offers two honest paths: set `cache = "none"` (the step always
runs and its output is non-hermetic, excluded from the shared build cache), or
add a non-secret `cacheSalt = "<token>"` that you bump whenever the
secret-derived output must change. The salt is your assertion and participates in
the fingerprint; Zolt does not read secret values into fingerprints. `inheritEnv`
is different: Zolt folds a digest of each inherited variable's actual runtime
value into the fingerprint (never the raw value), so a changed inherited value,
DB endpoint, or token re-runs the step on its own.

```toml
[generated.execTools.node]
runner = "process"
binary = "npm"
versionCommand = ["npm", "--version"]   # probed stdout enters the fingerprint
versionExpect = ">=10 <11"              # optional fail-fast guard
allowUnpinnedTool = true                # required: PATH bytes are unprovable

[generated.main.frontend-build]
kind = "exec"
tool = "node"
cwd = "web"                             # sandboxed, project-relative working directory
args = ["run", "build"]
inputs = ["web/package-lock.json", "web/src/**", "web/vite.config.ts"]
output = "web/dist"
produces = "resources"
into = "static"
timeoutSeconds = 900                    # per-step wall-clock bound (default 600)
cacheSalt = "frontend-1"               # required with secretEnv on cache = "content"; bump on secret-derived change
[generated.main.frontend-build.env]
NODE_ENV = "production"
[generated.main.frontend-build.secretEnv]
NPM_TOKEN = "CI_NPM_TOKEN"              # target env name = source var; the value is never written down
```

`tool = "project"` is a built-in pseudo-tool: it launches `mainClass` on the
member's own compiled classes plus resolved runtime classpath (Maven
`exec:java` parity). Declaring an input under `target/classes` — or using
`tool = "project"`, which always does — schedules the step after compile, so it
may produce only `resources`, `test-resources`, or `intermediate`; producing
main sources from main classes is a cycle and a plan blocker. `cache = "none"`
is the honest non-determinism escape for a step Zolt cannot fingerprint (a live
database, a network call): it always runs, is a hard error under `--offline`,
fails `zolt check --require-offline-ready`, and stamps `hermetic = false` into
package evidence.

```toml
[generated.main.build-info]
kind = "exec"
tool = "project"
mainClass = "com.example.build.BuildInfoWriter"
inputs = ["target/classes"]             # under the compile output: scheduled after compile
output = "target/generated/resources/build-info"
produces = "resources"
cache = "none"                          # always-run; excluded from --offline; hermetic = false
```

## Generated Producer Contract

Every generated-source producer — the OpenAPI and protobuf built-ins and the
generic exec step — obeys one contract, documented here the way resolution is,
because a build tool that runs third-party tools must be explicit about what
those tools may read and produce:

- Inputs are exactly the declared closure. Zolt expands the `inputs` globs
  itself, sorts them, and hashes their content into the step fingerprint;
  nothing outside that closure is an input, and a step never treats the network
  or ambient state as a hidden input.
- Output is exactly the owned directory. A step writes only under its single
  declared `output`. After a cacheable step runs, any file whose mtime advanced
  under the step's `cwd` but outside that output is an undeclared-output error
  naming the path.
- Tool identity is pinned or probed-advisory, and the fingerprint records which.
  A `jvm` tool is pinned: its coordinates resolve into the locked `tool-exec`
  scope, never onto application classpaths, and the SHA-256 of each jar is in
  `zolt.lock` and the fingerprint. A `process` tool is probed-advisory: PATH
  bytes are unprovable, so its identity is the binary name plus the probed
  `versionCommand` stdout, and it requires `allowUnpinnedTool = true` to say so.
- Skip is fingerprint-exact. A step re-runs only when its fingerprint changes —
  tool identity, argv, expanded input content, env names and literal values, a
  digest of each `inheritEnv` variable's actual runtime value, the non-secret
  `cacheSalt`, `cwd`, and `produces`/`into` — and its output bytes are hashed
  into the module build fingerprint, so a changed output invalidates exactly its
  consumers while stable output lets them skip even after an always-run step.
- `cache = "none"` is honest non-determinism, not a cache miss. It always runs,
  is excluded from `--offline` as a hard error, fails `zolt check
  --require-offline-ready`, and stamps `hermetic = false` into package evidence.
  Zolt never fabricates a cache key for an oracle it cannot hash; the sanctioned
  reproducible paths are committed DDL/schema or `cache = "none"`.
- Environment is curated, never inherited. A step sees only OS essentials
  (`PATH`, `HOME`), the explicit `inheritEnv` allowlist, the literal `env`
  table, and `secretEnv` indirection. `secretEnv` carries only names
  (`TARGET_NAME = "SOURCE_ENV_NAME"`); the secret value is read at run time and
  never appears in config, `zolt.lock`, fingerprints, plans, or logs. Because
  the secret value is never fingerprinted, `secretEnv` forbids the default
  `cache = "content"` unless you set a non-secret `cacheSalt` you bump on change;
  otherwise use `cache = "none"`. For `inheritEnv`, Zolt does fold a digest of
  the variable's actual runtime value into the fingerprint (an unset variable
  gets a distinct marker), so a changed inherited value re-runs the step.
- The refusals are the product. No shell strings or `sh -c` (argv arrays only,
  Zolt owns glob expansion); no lifecycle hooks or phase attachment; no in-place
  source mutation (formatters route to `zolt task` plus a dirty-tree check); no
  build-time network fetch as an input mechanism (a step that reaches the
  network owns `cache = "none"`); and no user classes in the build JVM.

## Quality and CI

`zolt check` is the umbrella for Zolt-owned quality checks. It can run local or
CI-oriented contexts, validate reports and coverage outputs, require package
evidence, require publish dry-run evidence, and check offline readiness.

```sh
zolt check --context local
zolt check --context ci --reports-dir target/test-reports --coverage-dir target/coverage
zolt check --context ci --require-package --require-publish-dry-run
zolt check --context ci --require-offline-ready
zolt check --format json
```

The CLI also has global output controls for automation:

```sh
zolt --quiet test
zolt --color never --progress never check --format json
zolt --timings --timings-format json package
```

## Supply Chain

Zolt reads the resolved dependency graph straight from `zolt.lock` to produce a
software bill of materials and license reports. Both commands are fully offline:
a missing cached POM is reported as `UNKNOWN`, never fetched.

`zolt sbom` writes a CycloneDX 1.5 BOM to stdout (or to `--output <path>`). The
graph, hashes, and per-member attribution all come from the lockfile — there is
no re-resolution. Output is byte-reproducible: the `serialNumber` is a
deterministic UUIDv5 of the lockfile fingerprint, and `metadata.timestamp` is
omitted by default (set it with `--timestamp <iso8601>`, `--timestamp now`, or
`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`).

```sh
zolt sbom
zolt sbom --output sbom.json
zolt sbom --include-test --include-provided --include-tools --include-dev
zolt sbom --workspace
```

Compile and runtime dependencies are included by default as CycloneDX
`required`; provided, dev, test, and tooling scopes are opt-in via the
`--include-*` flags and emitted as `optional`. `--workspace` aggregates the whole
workspace into one BOM: a root workspace component, each member as a library
component, and external dependencies deduped with member→dependency edges from
the lockfile.

`zolt licenses` groups dependencies by license, normalizing raw Maven license
names and URLs to SPDX identifiers. Unrecognized licenses stay `UNMAPPED` (raw
name kept, never guessed); dependencies with no readable license are `UNKNOWN`.
`--notices <path>` writes a deterministic `THIRD_PARTY` notices file.

```sh
zolt licenses
zolt licenses --format json
zolt licenses --notices THIRD_PARTY.txt
```

Enforce a license policy under `[dependencyPolicy.licenses]`. A license is
permitted iff its id is not in `deny` and (`allow` is empty or its id is in
`allow`) — deny always wins, and a non-empty allow-list is authoritative. The
`unknown` strictness (`fail`, `warn`, or `allow`; default `warn`) governs
dependencies with unresolved licenses.

```toml
[dependencyPolicy.licenses]
allow = ["Apache-2.0", "MIT", "BSD-3-Clause"]
deny = ["GPL-3.0-only"]
unknown = "warn"
```

`zolt check --check license-policy` (also part of the CI context) fails the build
when a compile/runtime dependency violates the policy, naming the dependency, the
license, and the policy line.

`zolt publish --sbom` attaches a CycloneDX SBOM to the publish as a supplemental
artifact (classifier `cyclonedx`, extension `json`). It rides the existing
supplemental planner, so checksums and signing apply to it uniformly; it is off
by default.

## Migration Explain

`zolt explain` statically audits Maven and Gradle projects. It can print a text
or JSON report, a migration readiness scorecard, a blocker report, or draft
`zolt.toml` files. The fixtures under `examples/migration-explain` include
Maven simple/multimodule and Gradle simple/multiproject/enterprise-style inputs.

Useful prompts for migration work:

```sh
zolt explain --source auto

```

By default the audit is fully offline, so a Maven project that inherits an
external parent (for example `spring-boot-starter-parent`) reports its inherited
dependency versions as unknown. Pass `--resolve-external-parents` to opt in to
fetching those external parent POMs and their imported BOMs over the network —
from Maven Central plus any HTTPS `<repositories>` declared in the POM chain,
cached under `~/.zolt/cache` for offline re-runs. Recovered versions are fixed
literals, so inherited `[dependencies]` and `[platforms]` resolve in the report
and in `--emit-toml`; anything dynamic (ranges, SNAPSHOT parents, unresolved
`${...}`) is surfaced as a review item instead of being guessed, and every
fetched coordinate is recorded in the audit.

Gradle BOM shapes map like their Maven counterparts. A `platform('g:a:v')` or
`enforcedPlatform(...)` import — Groovy or Kotlin DSL, a string coordinate or a
`platform(libs.x)` version-catalog reference, in any configuration — is emitted
under `[platforms]` rather than as a classpath dependency, and a version-less
dependency in a build file that imports a platform is drafted as platform-managed
`{}` with a review item to confirm the platform manages it. `enforcedPlatform`
maps like `platform` plus a note that Gradle's version-override semantics are only
approximated — the Zolt analog for a hard pin is a `[dependencyConstraints]` entry
with `kind = "strict"`, which the draft points at rather than auto-generates. A
`java-platform` project is recognized as a BOM (`gradle.bom.detected`), and
`zolt explain --emit-toml` drafts a `[bom]` member from it: `platform(...)` imports
become `[bom.imports]`, `constraints { }` pins (`api`/`runtime`) become
`[bom.versions]`, and a plain dependency declared under `allowDependencies()`
becomes a review item because a Zolt BOM carries no dependencies. Constraints the
static regexes cannot resolve (interpolated or computed versions) raise a signal
rather than being dropped.

### Verify a migration

`zolt explain verify` gives a factual, per-module comparison between what the incumbent
build (Maven or Gradle) resolves and what Zolt resolves, so a migration can be verified
instead of trusted. The incumbent is auto-detected — a `pom.xml` selects Maven, a Gradle
settings/build script selects Gradle — and `--source maven|gradle` overrides. For Maven it
runs `./mvnw` (else `mvn` on `PATH`) once as `dependency:tree`; for Gradle it runs
`./gradlew` (else `gradle` on `PATH`) once, requesting every project's `dependencies`
report in a single invocation. It then resolves the Zolt project/workspace with Zolt's own
resolver and reports — per module and per scope — what matched, what drifted in version,
and what appears on only one side.

```sh
# Compare the incumbent build and a Zolt project rooted in the same directory.
zolt explain verify

# Verify a Gradle migration (auto-detected when a settings/build script is present).
zolt explain verify --source gradle

# Point at a draft emitted by --emit-toml-output, and emit machine-readable JSON.
zolt explain verify --zolt-dir target/zolt-draft --format json
```

- Scopes compared: `compile`, `runtime`, `test`, `provided`. Maven and Zolt scope
  names map one to one. Scopes with no counterpart (Maven `system`; Zolt `dev`,
  `processor`, `test-processor`, `quarkus-deployment`, `tool-*`) are reported as
  per-module notes rather than counted as differences.
- Gradle configuration mapping: Gradle's classpaths are cumulative (`runtimeClasspath` and
  `testRuntimeClasspath` include the compile dependencies) whereas Maven and Zolt place each
  dependency in exactly one scope, so the compared scopes are recovered as set operations
  over the three resolvable classpaths — `compile` = `compileClasspath` ∩ `runtimeClasspath`,
  `runtime` = `runtimeClasspath` \ `compileClasspath`, `provided` = `compileClasspath` \
  `runtimeClasspath` (Gradle `compileOnly`, the Maven `provided` equivalent), and `test` =
  `testRuntimeClasspath` \ (`compileClasspath` ∪ `runtimeClasspath`). BOM/platform nodes and
  dependency constraints (`(c)`) are excluded so the resolved set stays jar-for-jar
  comparable with Maven's tree; `(*)` repeated subtrees are de-duplicated, `a:b:req ->
  resolved` conflict resolutions take the resolved version, and `project(":x")` dependencies
  are compared as ordinary resolved artifacts (mirroring how Maven lists reactor siblings).
  Annotation-processor and other non-classpath configurations are not compared, matching
  Maven's `dependency:tree` (which likewise omits processors).
- Categories per module × scope: matched (same `group:artifact[:classifier]` and
  version), version drift (same coordinate, different version — both reported),
  only-in-Maven, and only-in-Zolt. Zolt uses highest-version-wins mediation and Maven
  uses nearest-wins, so some drift is expected; the report states facts and counts and
  does not editorialize about equivalence.
- `--zolt-dir <path>` selects the Zolt project/workspace to resolve (default: the Maven
  project root when it has a `zolt.toml`). `--offline` resolves the Zolt side from the
  local cache only.
- `--repository-overlay maven-local` resolves the Zolt side through a user-local maven
  repository overlay, mirroring `zolt resolve --repository-overlay` — needed to verify
  overlay-backed projects, including directly declared `-SNAPSHOT` dependencies that
  resolve only from the overlay.
- Workspace members resolve with the workspace-root `[repositories]` and `[platforms]`
  merged in, matching `zolt resolve --workspace`, so shared root configuration is not
  reported as drift.
- Exit code is `0` when the resolved sets are identical across every module and scope,
  and non-zero when any module is one-sided or any scope shows drift or a one-sided
  artifact — so it can gate a migration in CI. `--format json` emits a stable schema
  (`schemaVersion` 1) with an additive `buildTool` field (`maven` or `gradle`); the JSON
  field names stay `maven*` across both tools for schema stability.

Both Maven and Gradle projects are supported. The comparison model, scopes, categories,
and JSON schema are shared; a Gradle build with a dynamic version, a missing included
build, or another unresolvable configuration fails the extraction with an actionable error
rather than a partial comparison, because a build that does not resolve cannot be verified.

## Platforms

Zolt ships only through the rolling `zap` nightly channel, which publishes native
binaries for:

- `linux-x64`
- `linux-arm64`
- `macos-arm64`
- `macos-x64`

Windows (`windows-x64`) is **experimental and not yet supported as a host**. CI
runs a non-blocking `windows-smoke` discovery lane that builds the workspace and
tests a couple of small modules from the bash bootstrap under Git Bash, and the
managed-toolchain catalog can lock a checksum-verified `windows-x64` JDK on
request — but no Windows native binary is produced or published, and rough edges
remain (for example, `zolt shims` emits POSIX shell scripts). Treat any Windows
use as unsupported until a native target ships.

## Good Fit

Zolt is strongest when you want:

- a project-owned Java build model in `zolt.toml`;
- deterministic dependency resolution in `zolt.lock`;
- fast local commands from one native binary;
- workspace-aware build/test/package flows;
- typed plans and JSON output for tooling;
- CI checks that understand the package and dependency model;
- migration analysis for Maven or Gradle inputs;
- native distribution and release verification for Zolt-produced artifacts.

It is still Java-focused and intentionally opinionated. For unusual build
plugins, custom Gradle logic, or framework behavior outside the implemented
lanes, use `zolt explain`, `zolt plan`, and the examples above to check the
current fit before assuming full drop-in replacement coverage.
