/**
 * Projects the aggregated workspace lock into an <em>SBOM-shaped</em> lockfile for one member, so
 * {@link WorkspaceMemberSbomGenerator} (running the single-project {@code LockSbomAssembler}) can emit
 * that member's COMPLETE CycloneDX graph — transitive components, artifact hashes, and dependency
 * edges intact.
 *
 * <p>Contrast {@link WorkspaceMemberPomLockProjection}, which is deliberately POM-shaped: it lists a
 * member's declared directs only, reconstructed with empty jar/pom hashes and empty edge lists. That
 * is correct for a POM (a POM declares only directs) but materially understates an SBOM, which is
 * supply-chain evidence: it must carry every reachable transitive component, each component's SHA-256,
 * and the external&#8594;external edges. The two projections coexist — the POM one feeds POM
 * generation, this one feeds SBOM generation.
 *
 * <p><strong>Closure.</strong> Starting from the member's direct coordinates (resolved against the
 * aggregated lock) and its workspace siblings, it walks {@link LockPackage#dependencies()} edges
 * breadth-first and retains every reached package <em>as-is</em> — preserving artifact paths,
 * jar/pom/artifact SHA-256 hashes, source repositories, scopes, policies, and the edge lists. Nothing
 * is reconstructed; scope filtering (dev/test/provided excluded by default) is left to the assembler's
 * {@code SbomScopeSelection}, which reads the carried-through scopes.
 *
 * <p><strong>Workspace siblings (fact: a sibling's own externals reach the consumer).</strong> The
 * aggregated lock attributes a sibling-owned external (guava, declared by acme-core) onto the consumer
 * (acme-http) classpath, yet a workspace lock entry deliberately carries an EMPTY
 * {@link LockPackage#dependencies()} — aggregation cannot attribute a sibling's own edges — so a plain
 * BFS would stop at the sibling and drop guava from acme-http's SBOM. This projection is therefore
 * workspace-aware: for every sibling reachable from the member it resolves the sibling's own
 * policy-merged {@link ProjectConfig} (via {@link WorkspaceMemberPolicyResolver}, exactly as
 * {@code WorkspacePublishService} does) and materializes a populated copy of the sibling's lock entry
 * whose {@code dependencies} list carries synthetic edges to the sibling's <em>propagating</em> direct
 * externals — its api/compile/runtime dependencies, the scopes that transitively land on a consumer's
 * classpath ({@code provided}/{@code dev}/{@code test} are NOT transitive and are excluded). Its own
 * workspace siblings recurse the same way, so a transitive sibling chain (http&#8594;core&#8594;util)
 * fully resolves. The unified BFS then walks those synthetic edges and each external's own edges,
 * pulling the sibling-owned transitive externals into the member's SBOM as-is.
 *
 * <p><strong>Directness (fact 6).</strong> The aggregated lock's {@code direct} flag is OR'd across
 * every member and must NOT drive a member's SBOM. {@code LockSbomAssembler} turns each
 * {@code direct()} package into a {@code root -> package} edge, so every closure package's flag is
 * re-stamped to this member's view: {@code true} only for a coordinate the member ITSELF declares
 * direct; sibling-owned externals and transitively-reached siblings are {@code false}.
