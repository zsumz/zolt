/**
 * Phase 2 for a plain repository: a dependency-ordered sequential upload (provider before consumer,
 * BOM last) of a family already staged in Phase 1. Every byte — artifact, POM, checksum, and detached
 * signature — is pre-generated, so a member cannot fail mid-way on signing or digesting; only the
 * transfer itself can fail.
 *
 * <p>Nothing is trusted blindly. Every path is PROBED against the SHA-256 of the bytes Phase 1 staged:
 * absent → uploaded; present with matching bytes → skipped (so a resumed publish re-PUTs nothing an
 * immutable release repository would reject, and a path that was recorded complete but has since been
 * deleted is re-uploaded); present with DIFFERENT bytes → a hard, non-resumable conflict. The primary
 * object itself is always confirmed, so a surviving checksum sidecar cannot mask a deleted artifact.
 * Any other transfer failure fails fast, persists the target-bound exact-byte transaction manifest,
 * and reports an exact resume command naming the member that failed and those after it.
