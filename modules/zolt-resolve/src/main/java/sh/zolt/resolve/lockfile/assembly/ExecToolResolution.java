 * One named exec tool resolved as its own isolated unit. {@code graph}/{@code selection} come from a
 * per-tool resolution (its coordinates as the only roots), so the tool's version line never collides
 * with another tool's or with the project's compile/runtime graph. The assembler tags every locked jar
 * from this resolution with {@code toolGroups = [toolName]} and merges jars shared with other tools by
 * unioning their groups; jars at a different version stay distinct entries.
